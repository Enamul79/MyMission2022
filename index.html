                              <p>You’re tired of second-guessing if your professional development efforts are meeting the mark.  You’re ready to build the professional learning your people need in order to be effective with young people. 

                              Time is of the essence. Young people need high-quality programming now more than ever. Your funders and partners are requesting your services. Now you must ensure that the teams on the ground have the knowledge and skills they need for successful implementation.
                                        
                              Without a clear system of high-quality training and support, your youth-focused initiative may not sustain.  Great staff could leave. Your program won’t reach as many young people as it could.</p>

                              <p>A developer community generally defined is a group of developers gathered in a place to achieve a common goal.

                              OK, you want to know what that looks like. I can understand that. The purpose of a developer community and the pieces that build the community puzzle are complex and different for each unique case. Developer communities usually stem from a general problem of information silos, senior developers spending their days answering questions rather than coding, or product teams creating things that their communities and customers don’t actually need or want.</p>
